# Travel Journal🏠

A simple web application to showcase travel locations.

## Features 🌟

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to both mobile and desktop views.
- **Dynamic Data**: Makes use of `data.js` to display a list of cards.
- **Interactive UI**: Clickable links redirect to Google Maps for each location.

## Technologies Used 💼

- React.js for UI components.
- CSS for styling (using Google's Poppins font).
- Local data source (`data.js`).

## Setup and Running 🏃

1. **Clone the repository**:

git clone [your_repository_link]

2. **Navigate to the directory**:

cd [your_repository_name]


3. **Install dependencies** (assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed):
npm install

4. **Run the project**:

This will open up a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
